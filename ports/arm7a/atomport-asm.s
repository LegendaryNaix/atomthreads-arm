 * archFirstThreadRestore(ATOM_TCB *new_tcb)
 *
 * This function is responsible for restoring and starting the first
 * thread the OS runs. It expects to find the thread context exactly
 * as it would be if a context save had previously taken place on it.
 * The only real difference between this and the archContextSwitch()
 * routine is that there is no previous thread for which context must
 * be saved.
 *
 * The final action this function must do is to restore interrupts.
